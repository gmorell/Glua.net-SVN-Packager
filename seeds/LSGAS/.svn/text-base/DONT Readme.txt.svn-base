Now that your reading, you will find everything you need to know about gas systems in this readme.

Whats Changed since Gas Systems for LS2?
========================================
 - Completely new Powered Thruster Tools.
 - Custom models for every gas device/storage
 - Recoded from scratch to support SB3/LS3
 - Nitrogen/Nitrous Oxide have been removed
 - Two new gases, Deuterium and Tritium
 - Pressing use (E) on a gas tank will tell you how much is in it, in your chat.

What Do the Devices Do?
=======================
Large/Small Methane/Propane Reactors - Make energy from methane or propane.
Large/Small Tokomak reactors - make energy from tritium and deuterium.
Tritium Inverter - Makes air from tritium
Deuterium Inverter - Makes nitrogen from deuterium
Methane Rehydrator - makes water from methane (hey, it's a game, anythings possible :p)
Methane/Propane/Deuterium/Tritium collectors - collects a particular gas. Requires a small amount of energy to run.
Natural Gas Extractor - Makes Natural gas
Natural Gas Processor - makes methane, propane, deuterium and tritium from natural gas. 

Console Commands?
=================
GASSYS_TankExplosions - Disables/Enables the custom explosion effect for gas tanks
GASSYS_MaxMultiplier - Maximum multiplier value allowed. All gas multiplier inputs will be capped to this concommand value.
sbox_maxgas_generator - Gas Generators Limit
sbox_maxgas_storage - Gas Storages Limit
sbox_maxgas_thrusters - Powered Thrusters Limit (same limit used by normal and advanced ones)

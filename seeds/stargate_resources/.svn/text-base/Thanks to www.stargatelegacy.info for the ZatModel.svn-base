Because garry added a stupid filter to garrysmod.org, I'm unable to upload my files containing an URL in it without getting it marked as dangerous automatically.
Furthermore, the mods on garrysmod.org (are there anyone else than garry??), seems just to click the "delete all" button.

So, here is the linkt from www.stargatelegacy.info which donated the cool Zat'nik'tel Model. Thank you guys (and in a sarcastic way: Thank you garry)

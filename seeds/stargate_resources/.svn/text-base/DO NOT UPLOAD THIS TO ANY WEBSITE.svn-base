Really - I hate the people uploading MY or OTHER PEOPLE's work to any site just because they have an inferiority complex.

When you wan't your name being associated with something awesome, do something awesome!

And be aware, packing these files into a zip with other stuff is forbidden as long as the other files aren't released under the GPLv3 too.

But you are free to add/change/modify these when you release your work under the GPLv3 too. Watch the license for it.

BUT I WOULD LIKE, WHEN YOU CHANGE STUFF, CALL ME SO I CAN ADD THE CHANGES TO THIS REPOSITORY SO EVERYBODY HAS THE ADVANTAGE!
It's better to have one package, which provides all the stuff instead of having 100 different.




The Reason why I do not want people to upload this is, I don't want others to download something e.g. from garrysmod.org what they think to be the "latest version" but they actually got an old crappy/buggy version so they start flaming me with bugs which have been fixed ages ago.
